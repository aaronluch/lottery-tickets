## Project Summary

### What does it do?

Our project is a game modeled after a lottery stand. The player is greeted with a main menu where they can:

- Purchase lottery tickets
- Buy snacks
- Play casino games

All interactions are text-based with rewards based on winnings. Players start with a balance of $1,000. The balance is saved to `bank.txt` when exiting, which is then used as the starting balance for the next game session.

Lottery tickets offer varying rewards for matching digits, while snacks provide in-game satisfaction and messages at a small cost. Casino games, including poker, blackjack, and roulette, allow players to wager and win against the dealer.

### Why did we build it?

Our goal was to create a comprehensive project that incorporated everything we've learned this semester. What began as a simple scratch ticket simulation expanded into a broader gaming experience with graphical text displays and simulated casino games. This project became a testbed for pushing our capabilities and exploring the theme of gambling within a controlled, simulated environment.
