- Lottery Tickets Python Game -

This program will simulate playing scratch tickets and roulette games.
No additional libraries need to be installed--runs on baseline python.

The program will load up and display a screen showing you everything you can do with a balance, selection of games, and a menu from which you can choose.

Each game has the rules written alongside it when you choose to play them.

After each game, your balance will be stored and updated upon winning/losing.

This balance will be saved to an automatically generated text file upon choosing to quit, which then will be referenced again if you choose to play the game another time.

*NOTE*: If you have a text file named 'bank.txt' wherever you place the python script, we would suggest changing the name as this program's balance is stored as 'bank.txt'
